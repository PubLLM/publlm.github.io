    <p>
        Just as pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have revolutionized the field of AI with 
        their remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, LLM-powered systems also 
        see great potential for contributing to the wellbeing of our society through public sector applications, 
        which often feature governmental, publicly-funded and non-profit organizations. This workshop brings 
        together researchers and practitioners from AI, HCI, and social sciences to present their research around 
        LLM-powered tools in the context of public sector applications. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Our workshop's target audience consists of 
        <ul>
            <li>(i) AI researchers looking to develop LLM-powered tools for public sector applications and address the
                real-world challenges raised by these technologies;</li>
            <li>(ii) HCI and social science researchers studying how LLM-based systems interact with humans and human organizations;</li>
            <li>(iii) Researchers and practitioners from public sector organizations looking to leverage LLM technologies
                for social good.</li>

                Malihe Alikhani is an assistant professor of AI and social justice at the Khoury School of Computer Science, Northeastern University. 
                Her research goal is to design inclusive and equitable language technologies. This involves developing systems that communicate 
                effectively with diverse populations, especially those from underserved communities. By integrating insights from cognitive science 
                and social sciences with machine learning, she designs computational models that capture the diversity of interpretation and reflect 
                the success of language as a communicative tool. She aspires to discern and address biases in learning models, especially in applications 
                such as education, health, and social justice. This aspiration has led her to collaborate with educators, healthcare experts, and community 
                leaders to create inclusive technology-enabled experiences.

            <p style="width:100%">
                Talk abstract: With the increasing deployment of language technologies to users, understanding the impact of natural language processing 
                models on society and behaviors is critical. We aim to design culturally responsible, equitable, and inclusive technologies that serve a 
                diverse population. This talk provides an overview of our projects in democratizing Large Language Models, focusing on making language 
                technologies accessible and equitable for education, health, and social justice. We explore two case studies: 1) developing 
                discourse-aware models for inclusive social media moderation, and 2) creating equitable machine learning frameworks for multimodal communication.

                Talk title: Rationality Report Cards: Assessing the Economic Rationality of Large Language Models
            </p>
            <p style="width:100%">
                Talk abstract: There is increasing interest in using LLMs as decision-making ``agents''. Doing so includes many degrees of freedom: 
                which model should be used; how should it be prompted; should it be asked to introspect, conduct chain-of-thought reasoning, etc? 
                Settling these questions---and more broadly, determining whether an LLM agent is reliable enough to be trusted---requires a methodology for 
                assessing such an agent's economic rationality. In this paper, we provide one. We begin by surveying the economic literature on rational 
                decision-making, taxonomizing a large set of fine-grained ``skills'' that an agent should exhibit, along with dependencies between them. 
                We then propose a benchmark distribution that quantitatively scores these skills and, combined with a user-provided rubric, produces 
                ``rationality report card''. Finally, we describe the results of a large-scale empirical experiment with 21 different LLMs, characterizing 
                the both current state of the art and the impact of different model sizes on models' ability to exhibit rational behavior.

          This track welcomes use-inspired research that develops LLM-powered tools to make positive real-world impact in the public sector. 
          Application domains include, but are not limited to, education, urban planning, public health, agriculture, environmental sustainability,
          and social welfare and justice. We also welcome submissions that tackle the common challenges in public sector LLM research, such as: 
          costly data collection, significant problem scoping process with domain experts, impact evaluation, high-stake domains yet far less 
          resources (budget, allocated staff effort, AI expertise), and vulnerable stakeholders. We particularly encourage submissions that report 
          on practically realizing these LLM-based systems in the real world, success stories and lessons learned.

          Track 2: Designing, deploying and evaluating LLM-powered services with directly impacted communities.
      </p>
      <p>
          This track invites submissions that investigate how LLM-powered systems fit (or misfit) into the human organizations that implement them, 
          as well as how those systems might directly impact community stakeholders who are on the receiving end of those services. Topics of interest 
          include, but are not limited to, participatory design on LLM-based tools/systems, understanding public sector’s needs and challenges of 
          integrating LLMs, interfacing LLMs with public sector organizations and end users, human oversight of LLMs, the role of LLMs in social justice 
          and equity. We particularly encourage submissions from HCI and social science communities, as well as public sector organizations.

      <p>Both tracks welcome two types of submissions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Novel work: Papers should be submitted in AAAI-24 template and limited to 7 pages (excluding references).</li>
        <li>Recently published work: Papers may be submitted in any format but should clearly state the publication venue.</li>
      </ul>  
  
      <p>
          All papers must be submitted as PDF documents. Author names and affiliations should be listed on the submission. Additional supplemental 
          materials may be submitted along with the paper. However, the main body of the paper should be self-contained. 
          Submissions violating these formatting requirements will be desk-rejected. 
          The AAAI-24 Latex/Word template guideline can be found <a href="https://aaai.org/authorkit24-2/">here</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
          Submission should be made through <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=AAAI.org/2024/Workshop/PubLLM">OpenReview</a>. This workshop is non-archival. All accepted 
          papers will be uploaded to the workshop website. If any author do not wish to make their camera-ready versions public (because of some conflict of interest), please
