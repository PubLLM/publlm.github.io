    <p>
        Just as pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have revolutionized the field of AI with 
        their remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, LLM-powered systems also 
        see great potential for contributing to the wellbeing of our society through public sector applications, 
        which often feature governmental, publicly-funded and non-profit organizations. This workshop brings 
        together researchers and practitioners from AI, HCI, and social sciences to present their research around 
        LLM-powered tools in the context of public sector applications. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Our workshop's target audience consists of 
        <ul>
            <li>(i) AI researchers looking to develop LLM-powered tools for public sector applications and address the
                real-world challenges raised by these technologies;</li>
            <li>(ii) HCI and social science researchers studying how LLM-based systems interact with humans and human organizations;</li>
            <li>(iii) Researchers and practitioners from public sector organizations looking to leverage LLM technologies
                for social good.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>


    <h2 id="dates">Important Dates</h2>
    <p>Be mindful of the following dates:</p>
    <ul>
    <li> <u>November 24, 2023: Workshop Submission Due Date</u></li>
    <li> December 11, 2023: Notification of Paper Acceptance</li>
    <li> December 23, 2023: Camera-ready Papers Due</li>
    <li> February 26/27 (TBD), 2024: Workshop Date</li>
    </ul> 
    <p><em><u>Note</u></em>: all deadlines are AoE (Anywhere on Earth).</p>



    <h2 id="cfp">Call for Papers</h2>
    <p>
        We invite papers from the broad intersection of LLM-powered systems and public sector applications, described in the following two tracks. 
        Submissions that simultaneously touch on both tracks are also encouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
        Track 1: Developing LLM-powered tools for positive outcomes. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This track welcomes use-inspired research that develops LLM-powered tools to make positive real-world impact in the public sector. 
        Application domains include, but are not limited to, education, urban planning, public health, agriculture, environmental sustainability,
        and social welfare and justice. We also welcome submissions that tackle the common challenges in public sector LLM research, such as: 
        costly data collection, significant problem scoping process with domain experts, impact evaluation, high-stake domains yet far less 
        resources (budget, allocated staff effort, AI expertise), and vulnerable stakeholders. We particularly encourage submissions that report 
        on practically realizing these LLM-based systems in the real world, success stories and lessons learned.
    </p>
    <p>
        Track 2: Designing, deploying and evaluating LLM-powered services with directly impacted communities.
    </p>
    <p>
        This track invites submissions that investigate how LLM-powered systems fit (or misfit) into the human organizations that implement them, 
        as well as how those systems might directly impact community stakeholders who are on the receiving end of those services. Topics of interest 
        include, but are not limited to, participatory design on LLM-based tools/systems, understanding public sectorâ€™s needs and challenges of 
        integrating LLMs, interfacing LLMs with public sector organizations and end users, human oversight of LLMs, the role of LLMs in social justice 
        and equity. We particularly encourage submissions from HCI and social science communities, as well as public sector organizations.
    </p>

    <p></p>

    <p>Both tracks welcome two types of submissions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Novel work: Papers should be submitted in AAAI-24 template and limited to 7 pages (excluding references).</li>
      <li>Recently published work: Papers may be submitted in any format but should clearly state the publication venue.</li>
    </ul>  

    <p>
        All papers must be submitted as PDF documents. Author names and affiliations should be listed on the submission. Additional supplemental 
        materials may be submitted along with the paper. However, the main body of the paper should be self-contained. 
        Submissions violating these formatting requirements will be desk-rejected. 
        The AAAI-24 Latex/Word template guideline can be found <a href="https://aaai.org/authorkit24-2/">here</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Submission should be made through <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=AAAI.org/2024/Workshop/PubLLM">OpenReview</a>. This workshop is non-archival. All accepted 
        papers will be uploaded to the workshop website. If any author do not wish to make their camera-ready versions public (because of some conflict of interest), please 
        reach out to the workshop chairs and we would be happy to accommodate such requests. Rejected papers will remain private and not posted in public.
    </p>
    <p></p>    




    <h2 id="program">Program</h2>
    <p>
        This will be a full-day workshop with several invited talks, panel discussions, a community session featuring public sector organizations,
        a number of spotlight talks, and a poster session. Full workshop program coming soon.
    </p>
    <p>
        Attendance is open to all. At least one author of each accepted submission is expected to present at the workshop.
